# Sample Python

This example is meant to assess basic python code competency. It is not meant to be a trick question, but rather a way to see how you approach a problem and how you think about code.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a new branch
3. Answer the questions below
4. Commit your changes
5. Push your branch to the remote repository
6. Create a pull request
7. Send an email to let Kyle know you are finished. 

Feel free to use any resources available to you, books, the internet, etc. You may also use any IDE or editor you like.

(Optional) If you would like you can record yourself 'solving the code outloud' while you work through the questions. This is acceptable and also encouraged. If you do chose to record yourself please send the video to Kyle as well as either a link to the video or the video file itself. Since this repository is open source you are more than welcome to use that vied as part of your portfolio and feel free to share it with others during your career search.

## Questions:

These can be answered right here in the README.md file. You can also create a new file and answer them there if you prefer.

### Written questions 

1. How does the Inventory class track and update the quantity of products?

2. In the SalesReport class, how is the total sales figure calculated?

3. What happens if you try to sell more products than are available in the inventory?
   
4. How would you modify this system to handle different categories of products?
   

### To be Submitted as a Pull Request

These questions should be answered by modifying the code in this repository. You can add new files, modify existing files, or do whatever you like. Make these changes all on one branch as part of a singe pull request. Each question should be answered in a separate commit. Feel free to code-split or code-merge as you see fit.

5. Can you implement a feature to restock products and reflect this in the sales report?

6. There is a holiday sale coming up. How would you alter this code so that we can have a discounted price without losing the original pricing? 

7. Currently this code has no “database”. Design a way to write the inventory to a file (txt or CSV or similar) and then also design a way to read inventory from a file. This will mean we can save or restore our inventory from a file. The format/name of the file is up to you.

8. Given 2 different database files, create a summary that explains any differences. In this example we can assume the inventory reports are from the same store, just at different times.
